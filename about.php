                <p><span>Farmers Guide</span> is a tool that can be useful to anyone who wants to learn more about
                    agriculture and understand the data behind it. We collect reports from different corners of India
                    and try to make our data as diverse as possible. This can help in making correct decisions about
                    what is required to grow a particular crop as per the information provided by many other farmers.
